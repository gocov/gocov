# What actually shipped? One command, three repos, two registries.
#
# A gocov release is not finished when the tag is cut. The CLI's binaries
# have to be on the release, the action has to pin the new CLI and its
# floating v1 has to point at the new action, the pipe image has to be on
# Docker Hub for both architectures with the new CLI baked in, and the
# pipe's tag has to exist on *both* of its remotes. Six things in five
# places, checked by hand until now — which is how the pipe spent ten days
# in August shipping a CLI two releases old without anyone noticing.
#
# Every check reads the published world over the network: GitHub releases
# and tags, the default branches, the Docker registry, Bitbucket's tag
# list. Nothing here trusts the working tree, because the working tree is
# not what users get.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/verify-release.sh            # verify the newest gocov release
#   scripts/verify-release.sh v0.12.0    # verify a specific one
#
# Needs: gh (authenticated), curl, jq. docker is optional — without it the
# one check that runs the published image is skipped, loudly.
#
# Exits non-zero if any check failed, so it can gate a workflow. Checks do
# not stop at the first failure: after a release you want the whole
# picture, not the first thing that went wrong.
