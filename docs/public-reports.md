# Public report pages

For a repository its forge reports as **public**, gocov serves the report pages read-only without sign-in: the repo
overview (`/repos/{workspace}/{repo}`), each upload's report, the per-file source view and the raw profile download.
Anyone who lands there from a badge, a PR comment's *Full report* link or a build status sees the same coverage the
world can already read the code of — settings pages stay members-only, tokens and every mutating action owner-only.

## What makes a repo public

Two things, both of which you control:

- **The forge says so.** gocov asks the forge for the repo's visibility and caches the answer. The cache is kept
  honest three ways: uploads refresh it once the answer is an hour old (a commit uploading many parts asks once, not
  per part), an answer older than a day is re-verified in the background whenever a report page is served
  anonymously — so a repo flipped private on the forge closes its pages within a day even if its CI never uploads
  again — and on GitHub, instances receiving the App's webhooks close (and reopen) the pages the moment the
  visibility changes. A repo flipped public opens the same way: by the webhook or the next upload. A repo whose
  workspace has no [forge connection](connecting.md) counts as private: gocov never guesses.
- **The switch is on.** Repo settings grow a **Public reports** switch for public repos, on by default. A workspace
  owner turning it off closes the pages to members only, immediately. Private repos don't show the switch and are never
  served publicly.

Anonymous visitors get exactly what a signed-out browser always got on everything else: private repos — and slugs that
don't exist — answer with the sign-in redirect, indistinguishably.

## What shows on a public page

The same report members see, minus the member chrome: no settings, no tokens, no actions. Uploads that arrived
[tokenless from a fork PR](pull-requests.md#fork-prs-without-a-token) keep their "unverified contributor upload"
marker on the public page too.

## Search engines see public pages

Public repo pages are made findable on purpose: each carries a descriptive title and canonical URL, the instance
serves a `/sitemap.xml` listing every public repo page, and `/robots.txt` keeps the sign-in flow, settings pages and
raw profile downloads out of indexes. Turning the repo's **Public reports** switch off removes its page from the
sitemap and closes it in the same move — search engines drop pages they can no longer fetch.

## The badge links here

The badge snippet the repo page and repo settings hand out links the SVG to the repo's report page, so a README
reader can click through from the number to the report behind it:

```markdown
[![coverage](https://app.gocov.dev/badge/myworkspace/myrepo.svg)](https://app.gocov.dev/repos/myworkspace/myrepo?ref=badge)
```

Self-hosted instances serve the same pages from their own host, and the operator can turn public report pages off
instance-wide — see [sign-in & access](sign-in.md).
