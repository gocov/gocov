# gocov

![coverage](https://app.gocov.dev/badge/gocov/gocov.svg)

Diff coverage, pull request comments and merge gates for GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket Cloud — an open-source
Coveralls/Codecov alternative. Use the hosted service at [gocov.dev](https://gocov.dev) (public repos free forever,
badge included), or self-host the same product: one Go binary plus Postgres.

![The gocov dashboard: workspace coverage, how many gates are passing, and one row per repository with its coverage, delta, 30-day trend and gate](docs/assets/dashboard.png)

## Coverage on your pull requests in three steps

1. Sign in at [app.gocov.dev](https://app.gocov.dev) and claim your workspace — it shows your upload token, once.
2. Add the token to CI as a secret named `GOCOV_TOKEN`.
3. Add one step after your tests (GitHub Actions shown):

```yaml
- run: npx jest --coverage        # or go test -coverprofile, mvn verify, pytest --cov, ...
- uses: gocov/gocov-action@v1
  with:
    files: coverage/lcov.info
    token: ${{ secrets.GOCOV_TOKEN }}
```

The action downloads the CLI binary and checks its sha256, so there is no toolchain to install — the same three lines
work whatever your tests are written in; point `files` at whatever your test runner produced. Recipes for the rest:
[GitLab CI](docs/gitlab-ci.md) · [Bitbucket Pipelines](docs/bitbucket-pipelines.md) ·
[any other CI](docs/ci-other.md) · [languages & formats](docs/languages.md)

From then on every push carries its own coverage: a status and delta on the commit, a diff-coverage comment on the
pull request, a gate that can block the merge, and a badge that is one line of markdown:

```markdown
![coverage](https://app.gocov.dev/badge/myworkspace/myrepo.svg)
```

## What you get

- **Pull request surfaces:** build statuses, PR/MR comments with diff coverage, GitHub check runs and Bitbucket Code
  Insights report cards with inline annotations on uncovered changed lines — see
  [the tour](docs/pull-requests.md)
- **Coverage gate:** per-repo minimums for total and diff coverage plus a drop tolerance; a failed gate pushes a
  FAILED status your forge's merge checks can block on
- **Any language:** Go cover profiles, LCOV (Jest, Vitest, nyc, c8), JaCoCo XML (Maven, Gradle, Android), Cobertura
  XML (coverage.py/pytest-cov, coverlet, gcovr), Clover XML (PHPUnit, Istanbul) and SimpleCov resultsets (Ruby) —
  detected from the uploaded content, no flag needed
- **Web UI:** repo list, per-file coverage, line-by-line source view with hit counts, coverage trend chart, SVG badge
  per repo, sign-in with your forge account

## Self-hosting

The same product on your infrastructure, AGPL-3.0, no telemetry and no call home:

```sh
docker compose up
```

This starts Postgres and the server on http://localhost:8080 (migrations apply automatically). Then
[enable sign-in](docs/sign-in.md) with your forge, sign in — the onboarding wizard registers your workspace and mints
its upload token — and set `GOCOV_TOKEN` and `GOCOV_SERVER` in CI. The path from there to a production instance (TLS,
the secret key, your own GitHub App, upgrades) is in [Self-hosting](docs/self-hosting.md).
